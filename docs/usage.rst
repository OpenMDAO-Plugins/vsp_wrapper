Using vsp_wrapper
=========================


The vsp_wrapper component allows you to use data generated by NASA's OpenVSP (parametric aircraft geometry tool) 
in OpenMDAO.  For this wrapper to work, OpenVSP must be installed on your system.  Visit http://www.openvsp.org/ 
to learn more about, and install this software.

The vsp_wrapper esposes the XML parameters found in the input container, executes VSP, and provides four outputs: 

::

    theoretical_area = Float(iotype='out', desc='Total area of all parts.')
    wetted_area = Float(iotype='out', desc='Total external area.')
    theoretical_volume = Float(iotype='out', desc='Total volume of all parts.')
    wetted_volume = Float(iotype='out', desc='Total internal volume.')

VSP can be imported from ''vsp_wrapper.py'', which should be in the site-packages directory of 
your activated Python environment once it is installed.

::

    from vsp_wrapper import VSP

Generally, the easiest way for you to import your existing VPS container into the OpenMDAO component is to use 
the ''set_as_top'' method.

::

    vsp_comp = set_as_top(VSP('my_input.xml'))

When the vsp_wrapper is instantiated, an XML file must be specified in order for it to run.
